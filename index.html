        <p>Hello my name is Owen, I was born in Barrie, ON and moved to Toronto when I was 2 years old. I am interested in the engineering field but I am also interested in coding and technology. I hope to get a job in one of these fields but I specificly whish to get into aerospace engineering. I wish to do aerospace engineering because I like jets and rockets.
